    * 1-to-1 mapping between contous and the sets that they represent.
- Free Rides (Shimojima, 1999)
    * Philosophers are not Mortal!

title: Syllogistic Reasoning using Euler Diagrams
class: med

- The major premise "No mortals are philosophers" is represented by the contour denoting "Mortals" being disjoint from the contour denoting "Philosophers''.
- The minor premise "Every Athenian is mortal" is represented by the containment of the contour denoting "Athenians" within the contour denoting "Mortals''.
- The conclusion "Therefore no philosopher is Athenian" is clear due to the contours denoting "Athenians" and denoting "Philosophers" being disjoint.

title: Syllogistic Reasoning
class: big

- Diagrams can assist in Syllogistic reasoning (Sato et al, 2010).
- Are we reasoning using diagrams or sententially?

title: Diagrammatic Reasoning
class: big

- Spider Diagram reasoning system is sound and complete (Howse et al., 2005)
- Previous examples show an application of the "split spiders" rule.

title: Intuition into Completeness Proof
class: big

- Each diagram has a minimal unique normal form.
- Given two diagrams \\(D_1\\) and \\(D_2\\) we
    * add all contours to each,
    * add all missing zones to each,
    * split all the spiders,
    * combine expressions.
- Similar to proof strategy by Molina, 2000.
- Purely an application of diagrammatic rules.

title: Expressiveness of Spider Diagrams
content_class: big

Spider Diagrams are as expressive as:

- monadic first order logic with equality (Howse, 2005).
- commutative star-free regular languages (Delaney et al., 2013).
- Spider Diagrams are weakly expressive.

- Layout is an unsolved problem.

---
title: Future Work on Concept Diagrams

- Tie down expressiveness result.
- More work on patterns.
- Prototype implementation.

title: Conclusion
class: big

- We have considered some of the work on Euler diagram based logics over the past 20 years.
- Fully formal (but usable) diagrammatic reasoning systems.
- For this talk I've ignored interesting work on
    * diagram layout,
    * diagram comprehension,
    * spider diagrams of order,
    * second order spider diagrams,
    * generalised constraint diagrams, and
    * any non-Brighton work on visual logic.
